# Topics to make sure we hit based on feedback:

* Use with fisheries dependent data. Can we? With what caveats?
* Use of environmental covariates
* Use with tracking datasets?
* Wrapping head around why we need the mesh + SPDE
* Model diagnostics and validation
* Integrating data types
* Common problems when starting out
* Is there likely a need for High Performance Computing with sdmTMB for fitting and/or simulation?

# Changes to lectures and exercises

- [ ] Drop priors lectures
- [ ] Drop barriers lectures
- [ ] Drop presence-only lectures
- [ ] Expand 'comparing models' into model validation: add simulation-based residuals, simulation and re-fitting, deviance explained. New slides and content in exercises.
- [ ] New slides on deviance explained in comparison lecture
- [x] New slides on Poisson-link delta models
- [x] New slides on generalized gamma
- [ ] Add generalized gamma and/or Poisson-link into exercises?
- [ ] New slides in spatiotemporal lectures motivating spatiotemporal fields 
- [ ] Tweak the 03-exercise to also try time-varying effects and spatially varying effects

# Old plan for the 4-day course

* Day 1: Intro to random fields, intro to sdmTMB, spatial models
* Day 2: Spatiotemporal models
* Day 3: Time-varying effects, spatially varying effects, index standardization
* Day 4: Extrapolation and forecasting, touch on other advanced topics (e.g., correlation barriers, presence-only data, priors)

Last time:
4 x Lectures + Exercises

Same this time but distributed differently

# New slides:

- Data integration
  - What it means
  - Things to worry about
  - Basic catchability stuff

- Multivariate
  - What you can do with sdmTMB
  - When to move to tinyVAST
