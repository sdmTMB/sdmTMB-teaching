----------------------

Extra slides to get in:
- integrated models
- simulation
- residuals

Extra slides to finish today:
- deviance explained?

Extra exercises to finish today:
- simulation?
- simplify biennial stitching exercise

---------------------
- extra stuff to add in:
- residuals
- simulation
- integration
- stitching

- dropping (but could include)
- barriers
- priors
- presence only

# Changes to lectures and exercises

- [ ] Drop priors lectures
- [ ] Drop barriers lectures
- [ ] Drop presence-only lectures
- [ ] Expand 'comparing models' into model validation: add simulation-based residuals, simulation and re-fitting, deviance explained. New slides and content in exercises.
- [x] New slides on deviance explained in comparison lecture
- [x] New slides on Poisson-link delta models
- [x] New slides on generalized gamma
- [ ] Add generalized gamma and/or Poisson-link into exercises?
- [ ] New slides in spatiotemporal lectures motivating spatiotemporal fields
- [ ] Tweak the 03-exercise to also try time-varying effects and spatially varying effects
- [ ] Deviance explained in exercises - with Tweedie or NB2
- [x] New slides on residuals
- [x] New slides on integrated models
- [x] New exercises on integrated models

# Old plan for the 4-day course

* Day 1: Intro to random fields, intro to sdmTMB, spatial models
* Day 2: Spatiotemporal models
* Day 3: Time-varying effects, spatially varying effects, index standardization
* Day 4: Extrapolation and forecasting, touch on other advanced topics (e.g., correlation barriers, presence-only data, priors)

Last time:
4 x Lectures + Exercises

Same this time but distributed differently

# New slides:

- Data integration
  - What it means
  - Things to worry about
  - Basic catchability stuff

- Multivariate
  - What you can do with sdmTMB
  - When to move to tinyVAST
